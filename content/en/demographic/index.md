### Demographic analysis of the top 15 bike municipalities

Only looking at the 15 mostly biking municipalities in Denmark there is a close to equal distribution between male and female cyclists. There are 19700 female and 17156 male, hence the women/girls are overrepresented by 15% compared to the men/boys. The population pyramid below illustrates the age distribution for both genders. Surprisingly, the ten to fifteen year olds either constitute a big part of the trip dataset or they bike relatively more often than the other age groups.

Every cyclist in the transport survey has 2.56 bike trips per day on average. The bike is mostly used for travelling short distances around 2-4 km. Hence, people use the bike to go around in their close surroundings, but what is their purpose at the destination? Work? Education? Shopping?

This interactive plot let's you investigate the bike trip purpose for people in different age groups.
