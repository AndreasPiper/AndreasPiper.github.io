## The average biker

Here's a few points that describe the average Danish cyclist. If you regularly use the bike as a means of transport and you live in Denmark...

**This is about YOU!** (on average):
- Live in Copenhagen
- Bike 3.4 km per trip in a time of 15 min
- That equals a speed of 14.3 km/h
- Bike mostly during the late summer/autumn seasons
- Relax during the weekend

You live in **Copenhagen** and usually make your way through the city on your beloved two wheels.

You bike around 4 km per trip, but it ranges between a few hundred meters and 10 km. Half of the trips are less than or equal to 2 km as illustrated by the median in the figure below. Your cousins who live in Aalborg don't bike as far as you. On average, they bike 2.6 km per trip and you often advice them to use the bike more often - it's good for the environment!

You have some friends who study at DTU in Lyngby and they bike to school every day. They are used to biking and usually bike a bit further and a bit faster than you.

The Bokeh plot below gives an overview of the average bike distance per trip versus the average bike length for the same 15 municipalities that are included in the boxplots. Each bubble illustrates a municipality and the size of the bubble is proportional to the total number of bike trips in the municipality. The dashed line illustrates the average speed! Municipalities above the line bike faster than the average whereas municipalities below bike slower.

**The average bike speed is 14.5 km/h**
