      <description>About the data sourceThe data used in this project comes from the Danish National Travel Survey (Transportvaneundersøgelsen), which is a survey that aims to gather information on the transport behaviour of Danes residing in Denmark [1]. The survey is managed by DTU Transport on behalf of a group of Danish authorities and organisations. Here are some key points that describe the survey:
 It contains a one-day travel diary combined with various background questions Every day contains several trips with different modes of transport Covers 365 days a year Regards Danish residents, 10-84 years of age Interviews are performed from 2006-2021  We will use two main datasets from the TU database.</description>

      <description>The average bikerHere&amp;rsquo;s a few points that describe the average Danish cyclist. If you regularly use the bike as a means of transport and you live in Denmark&amp;hellip;
This is about YOU! (on average):
 Live in Copenhagen Bike 3.4 km per trip in a time of 15 min That equals a speed of 14.3 km/h Bike mostly during the late summer/autumn seasons Relax during the weekend  🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚴‍♂️</description>

      <description>Distance MapIn order to illustrate the differences in commuting behaviour across Denmark, we decided to show some values in the form of a map with a breakdown by municipalities. Thanks to muncipaliteis codes available in data and geojson data is was possbile to map servel interesting properties.
In the first map the average number of kilometers covered by a commune resident. It can be seen that in suburb municipalities of Copenhagen e.</description>

      <description>Demographic analysis of the top 15 bike municipalitiesOnly looking at the 15 mostly biking municipalities in Denmark there is a close to equal distribution between male and female cyclists. There are 19700 female and 17156 male, hence the women/girls are overrepresented by 15% compared to the men/boys. The population pyramid below illustrates the age distribution for both genders. Surprisingly, the ten to fifteen year olds either constitute a big part of the trip dataset or they bike relatively more often than the other age groups.</description>

      <description>Green developmentLooking at all the bike trips in the dataset, we were interested in exploring the development in the use of bicycles to see if there has been an increase in this clean mode of transport. Moreover, we wanted to investigate whether there has been an increase in the use of electric bikes, since these are a great alternative for commuting by car if your don&amp;rsquo;t want to break a sweat on your way to work.</description>
